# Java String

**Strings** are widely used in Java programming and are a sequence of characters, used for storing text. A **String** variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:

    String greeting = "Hello, World!";

A **String** in Java is an object, containing methods which can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be determined with the 'length()' method:

    int stringLength = greeting.length();

There are a variety of other String methods available, for example  'toUpperCase()'  and  'toLowerCase()' which will return the string converted to uppercase or lowercase characters respectively.

Additionally, the  '+'  operator can be used between strings to combine them ( **concatenation**):

    String name = "Bob"
    String greeting = "Hello " + name; 
    // The greeting variable will contain Hello Bob
